# SyntaxHighlighter

SyntaxHighlighter is THE client side highlighter for the web and apps! It's been around since
2004 and it's used virtually everywhere to seamlessly highlight code for presentation.

This version is a fork 

## What's new

* The toolbar is back - add links to raw text version, Github etc.
* Better font support - you can now define weight and style rules in a theme.
* Better PHP themes - in particular theme's that resemble PHPStorm.


## What's planned

* Better PHP language analysis.

## TODO

Package up a release version? Or just make this the release version.
